# CS-300

1) The problem I was solving in the projects for this course was to define the algorithms and implement them for reading a CSV file, storing the data into a data structure, and using the data structure to manipulate the data using the tools available for that data structure. Project One was the pseudocode, Project 2 was the implementation.
2) The way I approached the problem was to first understand how data structures store and read data. The reason being understanding how each one is created allows me to understand how to use them. 
3) The biggest roadblock I encountered was creating keys for the data structure. To solve this, I turned the alphanumeric entry for the course number into a sum and product value to then generate the key from that. I also used the debugging tools to see how my data was being changed and where the data was being sent. Once I was able to create the keys, it was easy to finish the project. 
4) The work on this project has taught me about using different data structures, which requires me to create psuedocode to better understand how the data is stored and read.
5) The projects have not impacted the way I write programs too much, as I already practice writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I do so to avoid creating more work myself down the road.
